# Actuador
Analisys of two dinamical systems

This document will show the analysis and simulation of a micro-jet actuator which works with a gas that is inside a chamber where there is a membrane that acts as a piston,
thus generating changes in been in the mass of the interior of the chamber that in time follows oscillatory patterns.
In addition to the previous practice, an electro-mechanical system will be analyzed that allows the drive to fill a water tank by means of an RL circuit and a servomechanism
that receives a sensed signal of the water level and converts this information into the opening of a valve to the tank inlet.
